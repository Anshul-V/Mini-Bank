# Mini-Bank

## Introduction
This code implements a simple ATM system using C++. It allows the user to access their account by entering their account number and password. Once logged in, the user can perform various actions such as  viewing user details, checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and updating mobile number. The program uses a switch statement to perform different actions based on the user's choice. If the user chooses to exit, it displays a message "Thankyou! Have a good day." and terminates the program.

## Concepts used
* Classes and objects (OOPS)
* Control flow statements (If-else, switch)
* Basic arithmetic operations
