# Mini-Bank

Introduction 
This code implements a simple ATM system using C++. It allows users to access their accounts by entering their account number and password. Once logged in, the user can perform various actions such as viewing user details, checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and updating mobile numbers. The program uses a switch statement to perform different actions based on the user's choice. If the user chooses to exit, it displays the message "Thankyou..Have a good day." and terminates the program.
